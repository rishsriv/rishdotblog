# Here be dragons! Deploying Text-to-SQL LLMs in large enterprises

At my [day job](https://defog.ai), we have deployed text-to-SQL LLMs in dozens of large enterprises, with varying degrees of success. At some of these, these LLMs perform extremely well and get near-perfect accuracy. At others enterprises, they perform very poorly. This blog outlines what worked, what did not, and how you can use LLMs to implement text-to-SQL for your own databases.

## TL;DR
- Choice of LLM doesn't really matter. All frontier models (`gpt-4o`, `claude-3.5-sonnet`, `gemini-2.0-pro`, `deepseek-v3`) are good enough.
- It's super important to create good metadata. Column descriptions, table descriptions, and instructions are all important.
- Like all LLM problems, getting text-to-SQL right is an iterative process. You need to keep iterating on column descriptions, instructions, and "golden queries" until you get it right.
- If you have particularly complex questions or messy metadata, then "thinking" models, like [OpenAI's o1](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1) and [Google's gemini-2.0-flash-thinking](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking-mode) have the best performance (by far). They are slower, but the increase in performance is worth it.

## Defining Metadata

### Why Metadata Matters
Metadata forms the backbone of accurate text-to-SQL systems. Poorly defined metadata leads to ambiguous SQL queries, while good metadata provides the LLM with the context it needs to generate accurate and meaningful results.

### Key Aspects of Metadata

**1. Defining Company-Specific Terms**  
Provide clear descriptions for ambiguous columns. For instance, if `pricepaid` represents the price paid per ticket (not the total), include this in the column description. Similarly, clarify if `commission` is included in `pricepaid` or calculated separately.

**2. Handling Enums**  
For columns with specific values, such as a `status` column with values like `done` and `not done`, list all possible values in the description.

**3. Handling JSON Data**  
If you have a column containing JSON objects, document the structure. For example:  
```text
This contains a JSON with the following keys: "completed" (boolean type), "contract_amount" (integer type), "person_in_charge" (string type). 
```

**4. Hinting Joins and Indexes**
To improve query performance, explicitly mention which columns can be used for joins or indexing.

## Instructions
### Adding Context for Business Logic
LLMs require guidance on business rules and internal terminology not captured by schema definitions. Examples include:

- For "popular events," prioritize revenue over tickets sold.
- When asked about "users," always include their username and city in the results.

## Custom Instructions
Define specific instructions like:

- Always compute commission as 10% of pricepaid.
- Use username and city for user queries unless stated otherwise.


## Golden Queries
Golden Queries act as reference points, aligning LLMs with real-world expectations. Here's how to implement them:

1. Store golden queries in a vector database.
2. Use vector similarity to retrieve the top 3-4 similar queries for any given user question.
3. Add these as examples in the prompt to fine-tune query generation.

## Evaluation
Use tools like Defog's open-source [SQL-Eval](https://github.com/defog-ai/sql-eval) to evaluate LLM performance. Compare generated SQL against expected outputs by running queries on the database. This approach ensures accuracy in real-world conditions.


## Iteration
Improving text-to-SQL systems is an iterative process. Cchieving 90% accuracy is straightforward, but reaching production-grade reliability requires weeks of refinement. Key steps include:

1. Refining column and table metadata.
2. Iterating on custom instructions.
3. Expanding and refining golden queries.

## Conclusion
Deploying text-to-SQL systems in large enterprises isn't a plug-and-play task. It demands careful preparation, robust metadata, and continuous iteration. While the journey may be complex, the payoff—accurate, scalable, and automated natural language query systems—is undoubtedly worth it.
