# Creating a SSG MDX Blog with React Router v7

I have been meaning to move off my Notion based blog for a while, and was looking for an SSG friendly way to host my blog. We use NextJS for at our company. Worsening NextJS developer experience + Vercel's annoying lock-in made me decide to give React Router a try.

## TL;DR
- React Router v7 is a SSG friendly solution for creating a blog with MDX.
- If you want to just try it yourself, [fork this repo â‘‚](https://github.com/rishsriv/rishdotblog).

## Why MDX?
I wanted to be able to write blog posts with markdown in my IDE, and easily preview them using Cmd+Shift+V. I had 3 other requirements:
1. Ability to use code blocks, since a lot of my content might be code
2. Ability to use custom React components, for dataviz and other interactive content
3. Infinite customizability

MDX was the answer to all these requirements.

## Why React Router v7?
[React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/) is a lightweight, fast and powerful solution for creating a React sites. It used to be just a library that supported client-side navigation. But now (and with Remix features merged in) it also supports server-side rendering and excellent SEO options, which is what we need for our blog.

I wanted to avoid Vercel's lock-in, and also wanted to a SSG/SSR friendly framework that could be hosted anywhere. So I went for React Router v7.

## Cool Features

### Syntax Highlighting
Thanks to [rehype-pretty-code](https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev/) I can easily add code blocks in any language. Example below:

This is a language aware code block, which means it will get syntax highlighted and rendered as a code block. I just had to start the code block with \```python and end it with \```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
openai = OpenAI()
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say this is a test",
        }
    ],
    model="gpt-4o",
)
```
